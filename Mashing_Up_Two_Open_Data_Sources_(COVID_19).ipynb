        "As you may know, COVID-19 has played a significant role in impacting/changing people’s lives. COVID is known to be a deadly virus and without the vaccine, it can hospitalize people and even may cause serious death rates. Internationally speaking, it is interesting how data from different places are being gathered and used to determine the positivity rate (amount of people who tested positive). In addition to my project in curiosity, I will be using/pulling out data (CSV) based on New York City’s five boroughs (Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Manhattan, & Staten Island) to know which borough has the highest positivity rate. The start date of the data of the CSV file is to be the end of February 2020 (February 29th, 2020). Furthermore, I will also be using the data on CSV to determine the testing, hospitalization, and death rates within the dates provided in the code.\n",

        "For this project in the curiosity of this experiment, I want to know about NYC’s five borough positivity rate when COVID started to see how the positivity rate has changed. As a result of this project experiment, I should not have stayed with the same prediction of choice when deciding which borough has the highest rate of positivity in weeks, months, and a year. However, I have decided on Manhattan as having the highest positivity rate/number because it was where COVID-19’s first case started. In conclusion, by looking at the results of the output it seems that the (Borough: Queens) has the highest positivity rate out of all boroughs during the months and years. In addition (Borough: Brooklyn) is the second with the highest positivity rate."
